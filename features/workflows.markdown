      title: Frequently Asked Questions
      faqs:
        - question: Do I need coding knowledge to create workflows?
          answer: ChatterKB is designed specifically for non-technical users. Describe what you want in plain English and the system transforms it into structured steps automatically—no flowcharts or scripting required.
        - question: How complex can my workflows be?
          answer: Workflows can range from simple tasks to sophisticated multi-step processes. Search documents, analyze data, generate reports, and integrate with external tools in a single automation.
        - question: Can I connect workflows to my existing tools?
          answer: Yes. Integrations with Slack, Google Drive, Notion, YouTube, and Zapier MCP let workflows pull data from—and push results to—the tools your team already uses.
        - question: How do I share workflows with my team?
          answer: Save workflows to your knowledge base so teammates can run them without understanding how they were built. This preserves institutional knowledge and ensures consistent execution.
        - question: What happens if something goes wrong during execution?
          answer: ChatterKB includes smart error handling that adapts to unexpected situations. If human input is needed, the workflow pauses with a clear prompt so you can resolve the issue and continue.
        - question: Can I edit workflows after creating them?
          answer: Absolutely. Tweak any step, adjust parameters, add conditional logic, or swap tools at any time. Start simple and enhance as you go.
        - question: What kinds of results can workflows produce?
          answer: Generate structured reports, data summaries, visualizations, recommendations, and more. Save outputs to your knowledge base or hand them off to downstream tools via Zapier MCP.
        - question: How long does it take to create a workflow?
          answer: Most workflows come together in minutes. More complex automations take longer to refine, but you get results far faster than traditional automation approaches.
        - question: Is there a limit to how many workflows I can create?
          answer: Create as many workflows as you need within your subscription. There are no artificial caps on workflow creation.
        - question: Can workflows use my historical data and conversations?
          answer: Yes. Workflows leverage your entire knowledge base—including past chats, documents, and saved insights—so they always operate with full context.
