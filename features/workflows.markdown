  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  items:
    - question: Do I need coding knowledge to create workflows?
      answer: No, ChatterKB is designed specifically for non-technical users. You create workflows by writing in plain English, just like you would write an email or document. The system automatically interprets your instructions and transforms them into structured steps without requiring any coding or technical expertise.
    - question: How complex can my workflows be?
      answer: ChatterKB workflows can handle everything from simple tasks to sophisticated multi-step processes. You can create workflows that search documents, analyze data, generate reports, and integrate with other tools. The system allows for conditional logic and decision branches without requiring you to understand the technical implementation.
    - question: Can I connect workflows to my existing tools?
      answer: Yes, ChatterKB integrates with popular business tools including Slack, Google Drive, Notion, YouTube, and Zapier (which connects to thousands of additional applications). This allows your workflows to access information from and send results to the tools your team already uses.
    - question: How do I share workflows with my team?
      answer: Workflows can be shared across your knowledge base, allowing team members to run them without needing to understand how they were created. This preserves institutional knowledge and ensures consistent processes even as team members change.
    - question: What happens if something goes wrong during workflow execution?
      answer: ChatterKB includes smart error handling that adapts to unexpected situations. The system maintains context across multiple steps and tools, and can often resolve issues automatically. For situations requiring human input, the workflow will pause and prompt you with specific questions to resolve the issue.
    - question: Can I edit workflows after creating them?
      answer: Absolutely. You can tweak any step of your workflow after creation, adjusting parameters, adding specialized tools, or refining instructions. This allows you to start simple and gradually enhance your workflows as you learn more about what's possible.
    - question: What kinds of results can workflows produce?
      answer: Workflows can generate various outputs including detailed analyses, visualizations, formatted reports, data summaries, and actionable recommendations. Results can be saved to your knowledge base for future reference or exported to other systems (e.g. using Zapier MCP).
    - question: How much time does it take to create a workflow?
      answer: Most simple workflows can be created in minutes. More complex workflows might take longer to refine, but the process is significantly faster than traditional automation methods that require technical expertise.
    - question: Is there a limit to how many workflows I can create?
      answer: ChatterKB allows you to create as many workflows as you need within your subscription plan. There are no artificial limits on workflow creation.
    - question: Can workflows access my historical data and conversations?
      answer: Yes, workflows can leverage your knowledge base, including past conversations, uploaded documents, and previously generated insights. This allows workflows to build upon your team's accumulated knowledge rather than starting from scratch each time.
