      faqs:
        - question: What file formats are supported for document analysis?
          answer: ChatterKB supports a wide range of document formats including PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, PowerPoint presentations, JSON files, and plain text. Our system processes each format appropriately to extract both content and structure, allowing for meaningful conversations about your documents.
        - question: How does ChatterKB handle large documents?

Documents contain your organization's most valuable information, but traditional tools force you to manually search, read, and analyze them—a process that's both time-consuming and prone to missing key insights.

### Beyond Simple Search

Unlike basic document search tools that just find keywords, ChatterKB's document analysis capabilities allow you to:

- **Ask complex questions** about document content and receive comprehensive answers
- **Extract structured data** from tables, charts, and formatted sections
- **Analyze relationships** between concepts across multiple documents
- **Generate insights** that aren't explicitly stated but can be inferred from the content
- **Process information** at scale across large document collections

### The Conversation Advantage

Conversational document analysis transforms how you work with information:

1. **Natural exploration** lets you follow your train of thought without switching tools
2. **Progressive refinement** allows you to dig deeper with follow-up questions
3. **Context retention** means the system remembers previous questions about the document
4. **Multi-format flexibility** handles different file types within the same conversation
5. **Insight capture** lets you save valuable discoveries directly to your knowledge base

### Real-World Applications

Document analysis through conversation transforms workflows across industries:

- Legal teams extract key clauses and precedents from thousands of case documents
- Financial analysts query complex spreadsheets and reports through natural language
- Researchers synthesize findings across multiple academic papers and datasets
- Technical teams make sense of complex documentation and specifications
- Customer support quickly find answers in product manuals and knowledge bases

By turning static documents into interactive knowledge sources, ChatterKB eliminates the bottleneck between information and insight.
