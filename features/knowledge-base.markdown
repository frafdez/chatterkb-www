faqs:
  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  items:
    - question: Is syncing automatic or manual?
      answer: Syncing is currently manual by design. When content changes in your original sources (Notion, Google Drive, Slack), you'll need to initiate a sync to update the content in ChatterKB. This gives you full control over when updates occur.
    - question: Will syncing create duplicate content?
      answer: No, ChatterKB creates a copy of your content within its system rather than maintaining live connections to your original sources. This approach allows the system to process your content for AI-enhanced access while preserving your original workflow in tools like Notion and Google Drive.
    - question: What happens to my original files after syncing?
      answer: Your original files remain completely unchanged in their source locations (Notion, Google Drive, Slack). ChatterKB creates copies of this content within its system for processing and AI-enhanced access, but never modifies your original files.
    - question: What file types are supported for syncing?
      answer: ChatterKB supports a wide range of common document formats including Markdown, PDF, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, text files, and more. For Notion specifically, it imports the content structure including headers, lists, tables, and embedded content.
    - question: How do I update content after it's been synced?
      answer: When content changes in your original source, you can update it in ChatterKB by initiating a new sync. You can choose to sync individual files/pages or refresh all content from a particular source.
    - question: Can I control which specific content gets synced?
      answer: Yes, ChatterKB gives you granular control over what gets imported. For Notion, you can select specific pages. For Google Drive, you can choose individual files. For Slack, you can select specific channels. This selective approach ensures you only import relevant content into your knowledge base.
    - question: Can I share synced content with my team?
      answer: Yes, once content is synced to your ChatterKB knowledge base, it becomes available to all team members with access to that knowledge base, regardless of whether they have access to the original source. This makes ChatterKB an excellent way to centralize knowledge across different tools and platforms.

content_title: Why Your Business Needs a Knowledge Base

---

A knowledge base isn't just another folder for your documents—it's the brain of your business that actually understands what's inside those documents.

### From Static Files to Living Knowledge

Most businesses have information scattered across drives, emails, and team members' heads. ChatterKB transforms these static files into an interactive knowledge system that:

- **Makes information findable** when you need it, not just when you remember where you saved it
- **Connects related ideas** across different documents that traditional folders keep separate
- **Preserves context** so you don't have to remember why something was important in the first place
- **Grows smarter over time** as you chat with it and add new information

### The Foundation for Everything Else

Your knowledge base isn't just for searching—it powers everything else in ChatterKB:

- **Chat with your knowledge** to get answers without digging through folders
- **[Build workflows](/features/workflows)** that can access and update your knowledge automatically
- **Create dashboards** that stay current as your knowledge evolves
- **Share insights** with your team without creating yet another document

### Beyond Storage: Understanding Your Content

Unlike traditional file systems that just store your documents, ChatterKB actually reads and understands what's in them. This means you can ask questions in plain English and get answers drawn from across all your sources—whether they're in uploaded files, Google Drive documents, or Notion pages.

Think of it as the difference between having a filing cabinet versus having a knowledgeable colleague who's read everything in that cabinet and can instantly tell you exactly what you need to know.
