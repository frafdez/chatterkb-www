  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  items:
    - question: How does ChatterKB's memory help teams work together?
      answer: ChatterKB creates a collaborative memory ecosystem where each team member maintains their personal conversation history while contributing to a shared knowledge base. When someone saves valuable insights from their chat, those become accessible to the entire team. This preserves institutional knowledge even as team members change roles or leave the organization, while maintaining personal privacy in day-to-day conversations.
    - question: How is ChatterKB's memory different from other AI assistants?
      answer: Most AI assistants have limited or no memory between sessions. ChatterKB uses a user-specific memory architecture that maintains your personal context across all conversations within a knowledge base. This means information you shared in January is still available to you in December, creating true continuity in your AI interactions.
    - question: Is my conversation memory private to me?
      answer: Yes, your conversation memory is specific to you. Other users don't see your personal conversation history or memory, even when working in the same knowledge base. This ensures privacy while still allowing you to contribute to shared knowledge when you choose to.
    - question: What happens when I fork a conversation?
      answer: When you fork a conversation, ChatterKB creates a new branch that maintains all the context from the original conversation up to that point. This allows you to explore different directions without losing your place in the original thread. Each fork can then develop independently with its own local memory.
    - question: How does the Save to KB feature work?
      answer: The Save to KB feature is an active process where you deliberately transform selected chat conversations into permanent knowledge. When you click the Save to KB button, ChatterKB automatically formats your conversation into a well-structured document that becomes part of your shared knowledge base, making those insights available to your entire team.

content_title: Why Memory Matters in Business AI

---

In business, context is everything. Traditional AI assistants treat every conversation as if it's the first time you've met, forcing you to repeatedly explain your situation, preferences, and goals.

### Beyond Short-Term Memory

ChatterKB's memory architecture fundamentally changes how you work with AI:

- **Continuous Understanding**: No more repeating yourself or reestablishing context in every conversation
- **Institutional Knowledge Building**: Deliberately save valuable insights to your knowledge base, creating a growing intelligence system
- **Personal Context**: Each user maintains their own conversation memory within the knowledge base, ensuring privacy while enabling collaboration
- **Relationship Recognition**: The system understands connections between different topics, projects, and teams

### Save → Edit → Grow: The Intelligence Cycle

ChatterKB creates a virtuous cycle where each interaction builds your business intelligence:

1. **Have rich conversations** with your AI assistant that draw on your existing knowledge
2. **Save valuable insights** directly to your knowledge base with a single click
3. **Edit and enhance** these insights in our document editor
4. **Return to conversations** with an assistant that now understands your enhanced knowledge

### Beyond Chatbots: A True Business Assistant

ChatterKB isn't just another chatbot—it's a business intelligence system that grows with you. By maintaining memory across conversations and enabling deliberate knowledge building, it transforms from a simple question-answering tool into a true business assistant that understands your organization's unique context.
