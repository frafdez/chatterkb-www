      title: Frequently Asked Questions
      faqs:
        - question: What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
          answer: RAG combines large language models with vector search over your organization’s content. Instead of hallucinating, the system pulls evidence directly from your documents to provide grounded, explainable results.
        - question: How is this different from ChatGPT or document Q&A?
          answer: We build domain-tuned RAG pipelines with secure ingestion, retrieval optimization, and custom prompting tailored to enterprise workflows—far beyond a generic chatbot experience.
        - question: Can you integrate with our existing knowledge base?
          answer: Yes. We connect to SharePoint, Confluence, Documentum, custom APIs, S3, Google Drive, and more. We also support Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations for admin-governed control and auditing.
        - question: Do you offer managed hosting?
          answer: We support both customer-hosted and fully managed deployments. For regulated industries, we recommend your own VPC or on-prem infrastructure.
        - question: What industries do you support?
          answer: Core clients operate in life sciences, finance, legal, consulting, and manufacturing, but the architecture is sector agnostic.
        - question: Do we have to pick just one model?
          answer: No. We support multi-model routing to balance accuracy, latency, and cost across the best-in-class LLMs.
