  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  items:
    - question: What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
      answer: RAG systems combine large language models with vector search over your organization's content. Instead of hallucinating answers, the system pulls evidence directly from your documents to provide grounded, explainable results.
    - question: How is this different from ChatGPT or document Q&A?
      answer: Unlike generic chatbots, we build domain tuned RAG pipelines with secure ingestion, retrieval optimization, and custom prompting to suit enterprise workflows.
    - question: Can you integrate with our existing knowledge base?
      answer: Yes. We connect to SharePoint, Confluence, Documentum, custom APIs, or S3 and Google Drive folders—syncing and indexing your content automatically. We also build dedicated integrations that your admins can manage through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for fine-grained control and governance.
    - question: Do you offer managed hosting?
      answer: We support both client hosted and fully managed deployments. For regulated environments, we recommend your own VPC or on-prem infrastructure.
    - question: What industries do you support?
      answer: Our core clients operate in life sciences, financial services, legal, consulting, and manufacturing, but our architecture is sector agnostic.
    - question: Do we have to pick just one model?
      answer: No. We support multiple LLMs and can route queries across models to balance accuracy, latency, and cost.
