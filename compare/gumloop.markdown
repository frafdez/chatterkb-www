about:
  chatterkb: |
    ChatterKB transforms how teams work by turning conversations into intelligent workflows. Unlike traditional automation tools that require technical expertise, ChatterKB lets anyone create powerful workflows simply by describing what they need in plain English.

    With ChatterKB, your team can:
    - Convert natural language instructions into executable workflows without coding
    - Automatically capture insights and decisions in a searchable knowledge base
    - Connect to existing tools and data sources without disrupting workflows
    - Build institutional memory that grows smarter with every interaction
    - Deploy workflows that adapt to new information and self-correct

    Compared with visual tools like Gumloop, ChatterKB provides a conversation-first experience that preserves context, creates reusable knowledge, and scales across the organization with zero learning curve.

  competitor: |
    Gumloop is an AI-powered automation platform that combines a visual canvas with large language models. Business users drag steps onto an infinite canvas, describe what they want each step to do, and Gumloop’s AI converts that prompt into a working node.

    Key capabilities include:
    - Prompt-to-node generation for common business apps (G Suite, Slack, Salesforce, etc.)
    - Credits that can be spent on workflow executions, AI calls, data enrichment, and web scraping
    - Managed SaaS with SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA readiness, and optional Virtual Private Cloud deployments
    - Chrome extension to trigger flows from any web page

    Gumloop aims to balance power and usability, giving non-technical teams a low-code way to automate everyday tasks while still offering custom JavaScript nodes for developers.

  - title: Ease of Use
    cb_text: |
        ChatterKB eliminates the need for flowcharts entirely:

        - **Write, Don't Diagram**: Simply describe the outcome—ChatterKB handles the logic.
        - **Zero Learning Curve**: New hires build workflows on day one, no training required.
        - **Conversational Debugging**: If a workflow fails, just explain what happened; the system self-corrects.
        - **Contextual Suggestions**: Recommendations improve as ChatterKB learns your terminology and historical decisions.

    competitor_text: |
        Gumloop’s open canvas greatly simplifies traditional node editors, yet still requires users to plan and arrange each step:

        - **Drag-and-Drop Logic**: Map out processes visually, connect and configure each node.
        - **Prompt-to-Node Assist**: AI generates node configurations, but users often refine settings manually.
        - **Execution Credits**: Users must monitor credit consumption for high-volume or AI-heavy flows.
        - **Learning Curve**: Less technical than developer-oriented tools, but still demands understanding of branching, triggers, and data formats.

  - title: AI Automation
    cb_text: |
        ChatterKB embeds AI into every layer via its memory-first architecture:

        - **Persistent Knowledge**: Each run enriches an organization-wide knowledge graph.
        - **Natural Language Creation**: Entire workflows are generated, tested, and refined through conversation.
        - **Adaptive Execution**: Flows self-adjust based on real-time context and newly ingested information.
        - **Unified Experience**: No switching between AI tools and workflow designer—the interface is conversational from start to finish.

    competitor_text: |
        Gumloop leverages AI mainly for step generation and enrichment:

        - **Prompt-Driven Nodes**: Describe a task and Gumloop converts it into a node.
        - **AI Credits**: Large language model calls draw from the same credit pool as other actions.
        - **Stateless Flows**: Each execution starts fresh—historical context isn’t retained across runs.
        - **Custom Nodes**: Developers can add JavaScript for advanced logic, but business users may need assistance for complex branching.

  - title: Workflow Reliability
    cb_text: |
        ChatterKB's memory-centric architecture delivers superior reliability:

        - **Self-Correcting Workflows**: Workflows automatically adapt to new information and recover from errors
        - **Reasoner-Based Architecture**: Specialized components handle different tasks with focused context
        - **Intelligent Replanning**: When unexpected situations arise, workflows can replan steps without human intervention
        - **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Built-in monitoring ensures workflows complete successfully even during infrastructure changes

    competitor_text: |
        Gumloop's canvas approach relies on traditional flow execution:

        - **Manual Error Handling**: Users must anticipate and program error conditions
        - **Fixed Execution Paths**: Flows follow predetermined paths regardless of new context
        - **Restart Required**: Failed executions typically need manual intervention
        - **Limited Self-Correction**: Canvas nodes cannot autonomously adapt to changing conditions
    bg: bg-body-tertiary

  - title: Long-Term Value
    cb_text: |
        ChatterKB delivers increasing returns over time:

        - **Institutional Memory**: Every interaction builds your knowledge graph, making future workflows smarter
        - **Relationship-Based Learning**: The system automatically connects related concepts across conversations
        - **Reduced Training Costs**: New team members benefit from accumulated knowledge and context
        - **Workflow Evolution**: Existing workflows improve automatically as your knowledge base grows

    competitor_text: |
        Gumloop provides consistent but non-compounding value:

        - **Static Workflows**: Canvas designs remain fixed unless manually updated
        - **No Knowledge Retention**: Each execution starts fresh without historical context
        - **Separate Knowledge Management**: Requires additional tools for institutional memory
        - **Manual Optimization**: Workflows must be manually refined based on performance
