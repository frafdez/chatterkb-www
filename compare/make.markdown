about:
  chatterkb: |
    ChatterKB transforms conversations into intelligent, self-improving workflows. By combining natural-language automation with a persistent knowledge graph, it lets anyone—technical or not—deploy powerful processes in minutes.

    Highlights:
    - Natural-language workflow creation & debugging
    - Institutional memory that compounds with every run
    - 5,000+ integrations via Zapier MCP plus built-in internal tools
    - Predictable subscription pricing with unlimited executions

  competitor: |
    Make (formerly Integromat) is a visual integration platform where users connect "modules" on a canvas to build scenarios that move data between apps. Pricing is based on the number of operations each module performs, and advanced features often require larger plans.

    Key points:
    - Drag-and-drop scenario builder with custom expression language
    - Cloud-only offering (no self-host)
    - Charges for every operation, which scales costs quickly for data-heavy flows
    - Limited native AI functionality—requires external APIs and custom logic

pricing:
  chatterkb: |
    - Starts at **Free**
    - **Unlimited workflows** & knowledge storage
    - All internal tools included—no premium upsells
    - Zapier MCP: billed at cost, no markup
  competitor: |
    - **Free** plan with 1,000 operations / month
    - **Core**: $9 / month → 10,000 ops
    - **Pro**: $16 / month → 10,000 ops + advanced features
    - **Teams**: $29 / user / month (10,000 ops per seat)
    - Additional operations billed separately; every module action counts as an op

        - **Adaptive Execution**: Flows self-adjust based on real-time context and newly ingested information.
        - **Unified Experience**: No switching between AI tools and workflow designer—the interface is conversational from start to finish.
    competitor_text: |
        - **No Native AI Nodes**: Must call external APIs or webhook services.
        - **Stateless Runs**: Scenarios don’t retain institutional memory.
        - **Manual Error Handling** for AI failures.
