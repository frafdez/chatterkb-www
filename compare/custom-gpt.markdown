about:
  chatterkb: |
    [ChatterKB](https://chatterkb.com) transforms how teams work by turning conversations into institutional knowledge and intelligent workflows. Unlike Custom GPTs, ChatterKB builds compounding intelligence that becomes more valuable over time.

    With ChatterKB, your team can:
    - Save conversations to a knowledge base, building system intelligence that grows with your business
    - Fork conversations to explore different paths and ideas without losing context
    - Organize information with pinning and board features for effective knowledge management
    - Create and automate workflows through a natural conversational interface
    - Build a customizable knowledge base that becomes more personalized and valuable with every interaction
    - Connect to existing business tools and data sources without disrupting your workflow
    - Preserve institutional memory that would otherwise be lost in ephemeral conversations

    While Custom GPTs excel at specialized tasks within conversations, ChatterKB focuses on the journeyâ€”creating interconnected knowledge that compounds in value and transforms how your business captures and leverages intelligence.

  competitor: |
    [Custom GPTs](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts) are specialized versions of ChatGPT created for specific purposes. They allow users to define instructions, knowledge, and capabilities for ChatGPT to focus on particular tasks or domains.

    With Custom GPTs, users can:
    - Create specialized assistants for specific tasks or knowledge domains
    - Add custom instructions to guide the AI's behavior and responses
    - Upload reference files to provide domain-specific knowledge
    - Add basic web browsing, image generation, or data analysis capabilities
    - Share custom GPTs with others or publish them to the GPT Store
    - Access the assistant through the ChatGPT interface

    Custom GPTs are designed for specialized, task-specific interactions within the ChatGPT framework, making them excellent for focused assistance but limited in building long-term business intelligence or complex workflow automation.
