                body: |
                  When experienced operators and engineers leave, decades of process improvements, troubleshooting expertise, and safety knowledge disappear. New hires struggle without this institutional memory.

                body: |
                  Your team follows complex procedures manually because converting them to automated workflows requires technical expertise you don't have. SOPs sit in documents instead of driving action.

                body: |
                  Safety metrics, quality data, and compliance reports are outdated the moment you create them. You need living dashboards that update automatically as operations change.
