workflow_introduction: |
  Client onboarding can make or break the relationship. This workflow transforms the chaotic first-week scramble into a **smooth, professional experience** that sets expectations and builds confidence from day one. This one leverages [Zapier MCP](https://mcp.zapier.com). ChatterKB is smart enough to know if you've added [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) as your CRM. It just works.

  New Client Onboarding – Guided Setup

  When we start a new project, we want to move fast and skip redundant tasks. This assistant helps do that by walking us through only the essentials.

  First, it pulls client info automatically from the knowledge base if we upload an intake form or pitch deck. It should contain all of the information that follows:
  - Company name
  - Main contact (name + email) 
  - Industry/vertical
  - Project type
  - Budget and start date
  - Key goals or deliverables

  Next, it checks our CRM. If the company exists, update the record. If not, it creates one using the info above.

  Finally, it generates an internal handoff summary with key dates and any open questions.
