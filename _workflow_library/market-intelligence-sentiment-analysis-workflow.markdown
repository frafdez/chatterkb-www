  Market Intelligence and Sentiment Analysis Workflow

  Overview:
  This workflow helps marketers research competitors, industry trends, and brand sentiment by analyzing web content and organizing insights into actionable intelligence. Follow each step **exactly** as described. Map Steps to the Step Numbers and Titles provided below.

  Workflow Steps:

  Step 1: Define research parameters
  "What brand, competitor, or industry topic would you like to research? Please also specify any particular aspects you're interested in (e.g., product launches, marketing campaigns, customer sentiment)."

  Step 2: Gather web content
  Search for recent and relevant content about the specified topic using the web search tool. Collect articles, press releases, and social media discussions from the past 30 days.

  Step 3: Extract and parse content
  Use the web parser to extract the full content from the most relevant sources identified in Step 2. Focus on extracting clean text without navigation elements or advertisements.

  Step 4: Analyze sentiment and key themes
  Process the extracted content to determine overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and identify recurring themes, messaging strategies, and positioning statements.

  Step 5: Extract competitive intelligence
  Identify specific marketing tactics, campaign elements, product features, pricing strategies, and target audience information from the analyzed content.

  Step 6: Generate structured insights
  Organize the findings into a structured format with clear categories:
  - Sentiment Analysis (overall brand/topic perception)
  - Key Messaging Themes
  - Marketing Tactics & Strategies
  - Competitive Positioning
  - Emerging Trends & Opportunities

  Step 7: Create comparative data tables
  Generate structured tables that organize the findings for easy comparison and analysis:

  | Source | Overall Sentiment | Key Messages | Marketing Tactics | Target Audience |
  |--------|------------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
  | Source 1 | Positive/Negative/Neutral | Message 1, Message 2 | Tactic 1, Tactic 2 | Audience description |
  | Source 2 | Positive/Negative/Neutral | Message 1, Message 2 | Tactic 1, Tactic 2 | Audience description |

  And a sentiment summary table:

  | Sentiment Category | Percentage | Key Topics |
  |-------------------|------------|------------|
  | Positive | XX% | Topic 1, Topic 2 |
  | Neutral | XX% | Topic 3, Topic 4 |
  | Negative | XX% | Topic 5, Topic 6 |

  Step 8: Compile actionable recommendations
  Based on all gathered intelligence, generate specific, actionable recommendations for marketing strategy adjustments, content opportunities, or competitive responses.
