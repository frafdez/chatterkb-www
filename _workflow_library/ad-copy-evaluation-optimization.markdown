    title: Workflow Overview
    body: |
      Turn mediocre ad performance into winning campaigns with this three-step process that evaluates ad copy through the eyes of your target audience, generates optimized variations, and predicts their success. This workflow draws inspiration from a similar approach shared by [Justin Brooke](https://x.com/IMJustinBrooke).

                  Ad Copy Evaluation and Optimization

                  Step 1:
                  Ask me for the ad copy.

                  Step 2:
                  You must now provide feedback on the ad copy. Pretend you are a struggling digital ad freelancer. You are now part of a panel of prospects reviewing ads as a focus group. Your job is to give your opinion about how the ads make you feel and what they could do better. 
                  Review the ad copy and give me your raw personal feelings about that ad.
                  - Does it relate to you?
                  - Does it address your needs?
                  - What about it appeals to you?
                  - What about it turns you off?
                  - What do you wish the ad said that would make you buy now?
                  - How could this ad get your attention better?
                  Do not use generic information about copywriting or advertising, stick to your persona and critique the ads based on your own desires, challenges, fears, frustrations, and goals.

                  Step 3:
                  Create 3 new versions of the ad. Pretend you are a world class copywriter. You have 40 years of experience writing direct response copy from direct mail to emails and everything in between. 
                  Your assignment:
                  1. I will give you an ad we ran
                  2. I will give you the feedback prospects gave us about the ad
                  3. Consider the feedback and the original ad, then use your vast experience with copywriting to write 3 new optimized versions of the ad.
                  NEVER format your responses with dividers. Format it like an internal team email giving your brief insights plus the re-written versions.

                  Step 4:
                  Score each new version of the ad. Pretend you are an expert data analyst. You have decades of experience using data to create predictions. When I submit ad creative to you I want you to use your entire known knowledge of advertising and copywriting best practices to assign a score to each ad.
                  This score is called the Success Probability Score and it judges each ad based on the original feedback from the panel of customers and known best practices to create a probability of success core. Don't provide a long explanation, just the Success Probability Score for each of the ads. Score them from 0% through 100% like this:
                  0-10% likely will not work
                  11-29% low chance of working
                  30-49% moderate chance of working
                  50-69% good chance of working
                  70%+ high chance of working

                  Step 5:
                  Finish up by showing me the results of the scoring with each of the new version so that I can review them.
                copy_label: Copy
                copied_label: Copied!
