workflow_introduction: |
  This workflow automatically transforms formal company names into concise, conversational alternatives that are more relatable in everyday business communications. By creating standardized "friendly" versions of company names, your team can maintain consistent branding references across all touchpoints while removing special characters and unnecessary legal designations. This approach personalizes client communications, improves readability in reports, and helps maintain a more conversational tone in customer-facing materials.

  **INSTRUCTIONS**:
  You'll need to:
  - Prepare a CSV file containing company contact information with columns for: First Name, Last Name, Title, Company, Email
  - Upload your file when prompted by the workflow

  Create Friendly Company Names

  Overview

  This workflow converts formal company names into simplified, conversational alternatives by intelligently extracting the most recognizable parts while removing special characters, legal designations, and unnecessary modifiers.

  Workflow Steps

  Step 1:
  - Ask for a file name that has the columns:
  First Name, Last Name, Title, Company, Email
  - Create a spreadsheet called friendly-company-names.csv with only the header:
  First Name, Last Name, Title, Company, Friendly Company Name, Email

  Step 2:
  For every row:
  - Using the Company name, you are going to come up with a friendly company name and place it in the Friendly Company Name column. I want your to come up with your best guess as to what someone might call the company in a casual conversation. You must remove special characters from names (e.g., ™, ®, ©, etc.).
    Let me give you some examples:
      Alea Advertising = Alea
      Kai Communications & Branding = Kai
      Depirrow/Garrone Advertising = DG
      Alpha Co. Marketing & Media = Alpha
      The Lubrizol = Lubrizol
      EmpowerFi™ = EmpowerFi
      Midwest Promotional Models = MPM (this one I would say this way because it isn't using generic terms so abbreviation might make sense)
  - Now append those values to the friendly-company-names.csv including all of the value from all of the columns. Do not include the column headers or any extra text before or after the rows.
