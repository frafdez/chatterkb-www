  Customer Journey Decision Simulator

  Overview

  This workflow helps marketers understand how AI influences customer decision-making from initial curiosity to final purchase. By creating realistic buyer personas and mapping their decision journey, you can identify the key questions, concerns, and trade-offs that drive purchasing decisions. This insight helps optimize messaging, content strategy, and sales processes to better guide prospects through their buying journey.

  Workflow Steps

  Step 1: Define Problem Statement
  "What problem would you like to simulate? This should be a question where multiple valid approaches exist, such as 'Should I drink Coke or Pepsi?' or 'Should my small business focus on Instagram or TikTok for social media marketing?'"

  Step 2: LLM Selection
  Ask: "Which LLM would you like to use for this customer journey?"

  Step 3: Generate Representative Persona
  Create a persona that represents someone who might realistically ask this question:
  - Demographics (name, age, occupation, relevant background)
  - Context (why they're asking this question)
  - Knowledge level (expert, intermediate, beginner)
  - Specific needs or constraints

  Step 4: Customer Need Discovery Questions

  Verbatim (with substitutions):
  Using the llm_evaluate tool with:
  - Prompt: "As [persona], I'm trying to decide [problem statement]. What are the most important questions I should ask myself to better understand this decision?"
  - Evaluation Prompt: "Generate exactly three follow-up questions that would help [persona] better understand their specific needs and context for deciding [problem statement]. These questions should be open-ended, neutral, and focus on gathering essential information about their situation. Format your response as a numbered list of exactly three questions."
  Provide a brief summary of the results.

  Step 5: Decision Criteria Questions

  Verbatim (with substitutions):
  Using the follow-up questions call the llm_evaluate tool:
  - Prompt: "As [persona] deciding [problem statement], I need to consider these questions: [insert 3 problem understanding questions]. What criteria should I prioritize in making this decision?"
  - Evaluation Prompt: "Generate exactly three follow-up questions that would help [persona] prioritize decision criteria for [problem statement]. These questions should help them rank what factors matter most in their specific situation. Format your response as a numbered list of exactly three questions."
  Provide a brief summary of the results.

  Step 6: Trade-off Analysis Questions

  Verbatim (with substitutions):
  Using the prioritize decision criteria questions call the llm_evaluate tool:
  - Prompt: "As [persona] deciding [problem statement], I've identified these key criteria: [summarize criteria from previous step]. What trade-offs should I consider between these criteria?"
  - Evaluation Prompt: "Generate 2-3 questions that explore the most significant trade-offs [persona] might face when weighing different criteria for [problem statement]. These questions should highlight potential tensions between competing priorities. Format your response as a numbered list."
  Provide a brief summary of the results.

  Step 7: Final Decision Question

  Verbatim (with substitutions):
  Using the questions that explore the most significant trade-offs  call the llm_evaluate tool:
  - Prompt: "As [persona] deciding [problem statement], I've considered these trade-offs: [summarize trade-offs from previous step]. What final question should I ask myself before making a decision?"
  - Evaluation Prompt: "Generate one final, comprehensive question that would help [persona] arrive at a recommendation for [problem statement]. This question should integrate their understanding of the problem, prioritized criteria, and trade-offs. Format your response as a single question."
  Provide a brief summary of the results.

  Step 8: Final Recommendation

  Verbatim (with substitutions):
  Using the comprehensive question that would help arrive at a recommendation call the llm_evaluate tool:
  - Prompt: "As [persona], considering [problem statement] and this final question: [insert final question], what would you recommend?"
  - Evaluation Prompt: "Analyze whether a clear recommendation was provided for [persona]'s [problem statement]. Identify if the response: 1) Makes a definitive recommendation, 2) Suggests multiple options with conditions, or 3) Avoids making a recommendation. Also note any hedging language or qualifiers used. Format your evaluation with clear section headings."
  Provide a brief summary of the results.


  Step 9: Process Summary and Insights
  Verbatim:
  Provide a report that:
  - States the question that was asked
  - Which LLM was used
  - Includes a brief executive summary
  - Includes a section with the detailed persona profile
  - Explains the steps that form the decision process and what was considered
  - Determine what recommendations the persona needs to choose from and assign a probability score that provides insight into which would likely chosen (displayed as a list).
