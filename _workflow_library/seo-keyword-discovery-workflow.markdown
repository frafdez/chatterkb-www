  SEO Keyword Discovery Workflow

  Overview:
  This workflow guides users through discovering the primary keyword for a webpage through content analysis rather than direct questioning. Follow each step **exactly** as described. Map Steps to the Step Numbers and Titles provided below.

  Workflow Steps:

  Step 1: Get the webpage URL
  "What webpage would you like to analyze for keywords?"

  Step 2: Analyze the content
  Look through the page content and identify frequently used terms and phrases. Pay special attention to words that appear in the first paragraph and those that repeat throughout the text.

  Step 3: Check the URL structure
  The URL often contains important keywords. Extract any meaningful terms from the URL path.

  Step 4: Review heading tags
  Examine H1, H2, and H3 tags since these typically contain the most important topics on the page.

  Step 5: Analyze page title and meta description
  These elements are specifically crafted for SEO and often contain the primary keyword.

  Step 6: Identify potential keywords
  Based on the analysis, create a list of potential primary keywords and secondary keyword opportunities.

  Step 7: Evaluate keyword quality
  For each potential keyword, consider:
  - How well it matches the page content
  - How specific it is to the page's purpose
  - What user intent it addresses (informational, transactional, navigational)

  Step 8: Recommend primary keyword
  Suggest the most likely primary keyword along with 2-3 secondary keyword opportunities.
