        SEO Keyword Discovery Workflow

        Overview:
        This workflow guides users through discovering the primary keyword for a webpage through content analysis rather than direct questioning. Follow each step **exactly** as described. Map Steps to the Step Numbers and Titles provided below.

        Workflow Steps:

        Step 1: Get the webpage URL
        "What webpage would you like to analyze for keywords?"

        Step 2: Analyze the content
        Look through the page content and identify frequently used terms and phrases. Pay special attention to words that appear in the first paragraph and those that repeat throughout the text.

        Step 3: Check the URL structure
        The URL often contains important keywords. Extract any meaningful terms from the URL path.

        Step 4: Review heading tags
        Examine H1, H2, and H3 tags since these typically contain the most important topics on the page.

        Step 5: Analyze page title and meta description
        These elements are specifically crafted for SEO and often contain the primary keyword.

        Step 6: Identify potential keywords
        Based on the analysis, create a list of potential primary keywords and secondary keyword opportunities.

        Step 7: Evaluate keyword quality
        For each potential keyword, consider:
        - How well it matches the page content
        - How specific it is to the page's purpose
        - What user intent it addresses (informational, transactional, navigational)

        Step 8: Recommend primary keyword
        Suggest the most likely primary keyword along with 2-3 secondary keyword opportunities.

      title: Why This Workflow Works
      body: |
        - **Content-First Analysis** — Instead of guessing keywords, this workflow reverse-engineers what's actually working on the page

        - **User Intent Focus** — Evaluates keywords based on what users are actually trying to accomplish, not just search volume
        - **Actionable Output** — Delivers primary keyword plus secondary opportunities, ready for immediate implementation
        - **Repeatable Process** — Works consistently across different industries and content types
