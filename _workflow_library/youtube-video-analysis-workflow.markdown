        YouTube Video Analysis Workflow

        Overview:
        This workflow guides users through comprehensive analysis of YouTube videos by extracting and processing the transcript. Follow each step **exactly** as described. Map Steps to the Step Numbers and Titles provided below.

        Workflow Steps:

        Step 1: Get the YouTube video URL
        "What YouTube video would you like to analyze?"

        Step 2: Extract the transcript
        Extract the full transcript from the YouTube video using the transcript tool. This will provide the raw text content for analysis.

        Step 3: Generate executive summary
        Create a concise executive summary of the video content, highlighting 3-5 key points that represent the core message or information.

        Step 4: Identify key topics and themes
        Analyze the transcript to identify the main topics and themes discussed in the video. Note any timestamps for important sections when possible.

        Step 5: Extract actionable insights
        Identify any specific actions, recommendations, or steps mentioned in the video that viewers could implement.

        Step 6: Create structured Q&A
        Generate a set of potential questions based on the video content along with comprehensive answers derived from the transcript.

        Step 7: Compare with knowledge base
        Compare the information in the video with existing knowledge in your database to identify new insights or contradictions.

        Step 8: Generate follow-up content
        Create social media posts, newsletter blurbs, or other content formats based on the video's key points for easy sharing.

      title: Why This Workflow Works
      body: |
        - **Transcript-Driven Insights** — Extracts the full transcript for data-driven analysis rather than relying on surface-level metrics
        - **Layered Content Analysis** — Combines summarization, topic extraction, and Q&A generation for a multidimensional understanding of the video
        - **Knowledge Integration** — Compares video content with your existing knowledge base to surface new insights or contradictions
        - **Repurposable Output** — Delivers ready-to-use content snippets that can be instantly shared across channels
        - **Scalable Process** — Works consistently across different video lengths and subject matters
