                  Calendar Event Research - Company and Contact

                  Overview

                  This workflow automates pre-meeting intelligence gathering by researching attendees and their organizations, providing you with valuable context and talking points before every interaction.

                  Workflow Steps

                  Step 1:
                  - Check the calendar for tomorrow's upcoming events.

                  Step 2:
                  For each event...
                  - Search the web for the email address of the contact looking for posts on Reddit, LinkedIn, or any other social media site.
                  - Pay attention to the domain of the contact's email and search for that company's domain (if it represents a company and not a mail service). Search the web for any interesting and recent news about the company.
                  - Search go to any of the pages mentioned by the web search to acquire additional information.
                  - If the contact or company information does not match the exact email address or domain name, do not consider it valid and do not reference it or assume that there is a similar or related link. This is important.

                  Step 3:
                  - Summarize all of the research with a section per event (with company and contact sections).
                  - Then, send an email to me with the subject "Tomorrow's Event Research" that includes summary sections.
