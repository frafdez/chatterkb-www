## Credits Breakdown
Credits are how we measure the cost of each chat or workflow step. This table shows a rough guide for the simplest possible chat with each model. Think of it as a relative scale: some models sip credits, others use more. **Actual usage can be higher** depending on the length of the conversation, the tools you’ve connected, and whether you’re running workflows.
